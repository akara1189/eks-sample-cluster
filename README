This repo contains a few scripts and some Kubernetes configuration files that are build to create a quick, small AWS EKS cluster using EKS "auto-mode" to provision everything. It's the most basic of configurations designed to demo the basic functionality, especially the use of Node Classes and Node Pools to automate provisioning via Karpenter. 

Note that Auto-Mode offers "Karpenter as a service" and Karpenter itself runs off-cluster. This allows the automatic control of nodes before Karpenter is installed, preventing a "chicken or the egg" situation.

Contents:

/configuration_files/ : Contains Kubernetes configuration files for eksctl (To create the actual cluster), a default Node Class to select basic information on where VMs should be spun up, a default Node Pool to spawn smaller nodes than the usual default Node Pools would (To keep testing cheap), an IAM trust policy to allow EKS to manage EC2 for you (Standard for any managed EKS nodes) and "test_script.sh" which is the container entrypoint and runs the container smoke testing as well as the cluster build.

Dockerfile: Builds tools image. Not the slickest setup but built for a down and dirty testing container.

default.config: Template for supplying AWS credentials. This should normally be done via Role assumption but this is for testing purposes. Don't generally do this in Production.

build_script.sh: Builds and runs Docker container.
